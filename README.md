# Software Developer Folio ⚡️ 

## A clean, beautiful and responsive portfolio!

Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Customize portfolio theme by using your own color scheme globally in the  `src/_globalColor.scss` file. Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as much as you want.

If you'd like to **contribute** and make this much better for other users, have a look at [Issues](https://github.com/siddhi117/sshah117.github.io/issues).

Created something awesome for your fork of the portfolio and want to share it? Feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/siddhi117/sshah117.github.io/pulls).

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

### Docker Commands

## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run portfolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need. You will also need to modify `index.html` to change the title and metadata to provide accurate SEO for your personal portfolio.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

const greeting = {
  username: "Siddhi Shah",
  title: "Hi all, I'm Siddhi",
  subTitle: emoji(
    "Hello! I’m Siddhi, Results-driven Software Developer with 5+ years of experience building secure, scalable applications and microservices using C#, Java, .NET, and AWS.Experienced Software Developer skilled in full-stack development, system design, and cloud-native architectures. Motivated to expand expertise in AI while contributing to innovative and high-performance engineering teams."
  ),
    resumeLink:
    "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBWxumixUP97ttTeszthKMa3tA5zJQ-O/view?usp=drive_link", // Set to empty to hide the button
  displayGreeting: true // Set false to hide this section, defaults to true
};

// Social Media Links

const socialMediaLinks = {
  github: "https://github.com/siddhi117",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sshah94/",
  gmail: "siddhi117@gmail.com",
    facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/siddhi.shah.336",
  // Instagram, Twitter and Kaggle are also supported in the links!
  // To customize icons and social links, tweak src/components/SocialMedia
  display: true // Set true to display this section, defaults to false
};


const skillsSection = { .... }

```
#### Resume upload
To upload your own resume, simply upload a pdf to `src/containers/greeting/resume` and rename the pdf to `resume.pdf`. 

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji 😃 into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.

#### Adding Twitter Time line to your Page
Insert your Twitter username in `portfolio.js` to show your recent activity on your page.

```javascript
const twitterDetails = {
  userName : "Your Twitter Username"
};
```
Note: Don't use `@` symbol when adding username.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.

The Profile and the Repository information from GitHub is only created at the time of deploy and the site needs to be redeployed if those information needs to be updated. So, a configurable [CRON Job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) is setup which deploys your site every week, so that once you update your profile on GitHub it is shown on your portfolio. You can also trigger it manually using `workflow_dispatch` event, see [this guide](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch) on how to do that.

- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend to read through the [GitHub Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on GitHub pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://sshah117.github.io/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
